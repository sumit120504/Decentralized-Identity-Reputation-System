# Decentralized Identity & Reputation System (DID-Core)

## 📘 Project Title

**DID-Core: A Decentralized Identity & Reputation System for Core DAO**

---

## 📄 Project Description

DID-Core is an on-chain identity management and reputation scoring protocol designed for the Core DAO ecosystem. It enables users to register a decentralized identity (DID), attach off-chain verifiable credentials, and be assigned trust scores through a network of authorized verifiers.

The system is built to support **zk-proof verification**, **reputation updates**, and **Sybil resistance**, all while respecting user privacy. Each identity is represented by a unique Ethereum-compatible wallet address and associated metadata stored off-chain (e.g., IPFS or Arweave).

---

## 🌐 Project Vision

The long-term goal of DID-Core is to serve as the **trust layer** for decentralized applications on Core DAO. By offering a unified, privacy-preserving, and decentralized identity system, we aim to:

- Eliminate Sybil attacks in governance and incentive mechanisms.
- Provide KYC-lite compliance for DeFi protocols.
- Enable anonymous yet verifiable user onboarding using zero-knowledge proofs.
- Build a cross-chain identity reputation network integrated with the broader Web3 ecosystem.

---

## 🔭 Future Scope

- 🔐 **Zero-Knowledge Proof Integration**: Integrate zk-SNARKs for on-chain identity verification via projects like Semaphore or Noir.
- 🧬 **Cross-Chain Identity Syncing**: Enable DID portability across multiple chains (e.g., Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum).
- 🪪 **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)**: Issue non-transferable tokens to verified users representing their credentials.
- 🗳️ **DAO-Gated Voting**: Use identity reputation to weight governance votes.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Reputation Engine**: Automatically update user scores based on on-chain activity and off-chain signals.

## 🔑 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📝 DID Registration | Users register a decentralized identity using their wallet and a metadata URI. |
| ✅ Verifier-Based Identity Verification | Trusted verifiers (e.g., KYC providers, zk-relays) can verify identities. |
| 🌟 Reputation Scoring | Verifiers can assign and update user trust scores. |
| 🧾 Off-Chain Credential Linking | Supports external encrypted metadata (IPFS, Arweave). |
| 🔐 Privacy-Preserving Architecture | Supports zero-knowledge proof integration for anonymous identity verification. |
| 🛠️ Modular Governance | Verifiers managed through admin contract (upgradable to DAO control). |
| 🔗 Core DAO Compatible | Fully deployable on Core DAO's EVM-compatible architecture. |
